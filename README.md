### DigHum-101-Summer-2020

**This is a repository for DigHum 101, a course that I took in Summer 2020. This course equips students with Data Science tools and knowledge to solve humanities centered problems in a data-driven manner, and also forces them to think about what implications their data-driven solutions have on society.**
